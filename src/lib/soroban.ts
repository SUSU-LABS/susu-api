/**
 * Soroban RPC access, from the server.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
 * The document's API surface includes `POST /transactions/prepare`, and its
 * transaction UX is "Validate → Build → Simulate → Show details → Wallet
 * signature → …". Simulation is the step where the contract itself decides whether
 * a call would be accepted, which is why it happens before the wallet is asked to
 * approve anything.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT ALLOWED TO BECOME
 * This service never holds a key, never signs, and never submits. `prepare` takes
 * an envelope the client built and hands back the same call with a footprint and
 * resource fee filled in; the wallet signs it and the client submits it. So a
 * compromise of this API cannot move funds: it cannot change which contract is
 * called or with what arguments, and it has nothing to sign with.
 *
 * The client is free to ignore this path entirely and simulate against RPC itself.
 * That matters: a write must not depend on this service being up, and the web app
 * keeps its own path for exactly that reason.

 * over plain HTTP, and refusing that would mean `prepare` could not be exercised
 * against the network it is developed on.
