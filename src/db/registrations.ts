/**
 * Group registrations: remembering a group address the chain just produced.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * A group's address is the hash of its own deployment, so the only way to learn a
 * group exists is to watch the Factory emit it. The indexer does that on a
 * schedule, so there is a window after a creator's confirmation in which the
 * address is real and this API has never heard of it. During that window the
 * creator cannot invite anyone, because creating an invite requires the API to
 * recognise the group.
 *
 * A registration bridges that window. It is an address, the account that claimed
 * it, and an expiry — nothing else. It is not a group: it carries no amount, no
 * membership and no status, nothing financial reads it, and it cannot make a
 * contract exist. The index remains the authority on what a group is, and an
 * indexed row makes the claim redundant simply by arriving.
 *
 * THE EXPIRY IS THE SECURITY PROPERTY
 * Nothing has to run for a false claim to stop being believed; the clock does it.
 * That is what makes a claim acceptable without verifying it against the chain:
 * the exposure is bounded in time, and the table cannot accumulate unverified
 * addresses that outlive the indexing lag they were meant to cover.
 *
 * A CAP, SO THE WINDOW CANNOT BE HELD OPEN AT SCALE
 * One account may hold a few live registrations at once. Without the cap an
 * account could register addresses indefinitely and keep a standing list of
 * unverified addresses the API would treat as groups. The cap is deliberately
 * small: a creator needs one, or one per group they are creating, and the honest
 * use of this table is rare.
