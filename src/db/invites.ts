/**
 * The invite store: creating codes, and redeeming them exactly once.
 *
 * Redemption is the interesting operation. `invite_links.uses` is a counter with
 * a ceiling, and two things have to be true at the same time that a counter
 * alone cannot express:
 *
 *   1. Concurrent joins must not exceed `max_uses`. That needs a lock, not a
 *      read-then-write, or two requests can both read `uses = 4` against a
 *      ceiling of 5 and both write 5.
 *   2. A member redeeming the same code twice must not consume two uses. That
 *      needs the identity of the redeemer, which is what `invite_redemptions`
 *      records; the unique key on the pair makes the second attempt a no-op
 *      rather than a second increment.
 *
 * So the write part of the redemption is one transaction: the invite row is
 * locked, the existing redemption is looked for, capacity is checked, and the
 * redemption row and the counter are written together. The lock is what makes
 * the capacity check meaningful; the unique index is what makes the redemption
 * idempotent. The `shouldClaim` check is resolved *before* the transaction,
 * because it reads the read model over the shared pool: awaiting it while holding
 * the invite lock would hold that lock across a network round trip and let
 * concurrent redemptions exhaust the pool.
 *
 * The chain is still the authority on who may join and how large a group is.
 * This endpoint resolves a code and claims a use so that a limited invite is not
 * issued more times than it allows — nothing more.
 *
 * A USE IS NOT SPENT ON A JOIN THAT CANNOT HAPPEN
 * A code can outlive the window it was made for: groups open, fill, and start,
 * and a link shared before that keeps working afterwards. Redeeming such a code
 * used to consume a use and then discover, from the client's first read of the
 * group, that joining was never possible. `shouldClaim` lets the caller decline
 * the claim in that case, so the invite is left intact. The code still resolves,
 * because the client needs the group's address to explain what happened.
