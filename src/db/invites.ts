/**
 * The invite store: creating codes, and redeeming them exactly once.
 *
 * Redemption is the interesting operation. `invite_links.uses` is a counter with
 * a ceiling, and two things have to be true at the same time that a counter
 * alone cannot express:
 *
 *   1. Concurrent joins must not exceed `max_uses`. That needs a lock, not a
 *      read-then-write, or two requests can both read `uses = 4` against a
 *      ceiling of 5 and both write 5.
 *   2. A member redeeming the same code twice must not consume two uses. That
 *      needs the identity of the redeemer, which is what `invite_redemptions`
 *      records; the unique key on the pair makes the second attempt a no-op
 *      rather than a second increment.
 *
 * So the whole redemption is one transaction: the invite row is locked, the
 * existing redemption is looked for, capacity is checked, and the redemption row
 * and the counter are written together. The lock is what makes the capacity check
 * meaningful; the unique index is what makes the redemption idempotent.
 *
 * The chain is still the authority on who may join and how large a group is.
 * This endpoint resolves a code and claims a use so that a limited invite is not
 * issued more times than it allows — nothing more.
 *
 * A USE IS NOT SPENT ON A JOIN THAT CANNOT HAPPEN
 * A code can outlive the window it was made for: groups open, fill, and start,
 * and a link shared before that keeps working afterwards. Redeeming such a code
 * used to consume a use and then discover, from the client's first read of the
 * group, that joining was never possible. `shouldClaim` lets the caller decline
 * the claim in that case, so the invite is left intact. The code still resolves,
 * because the client needs the group's address to explain what happened.

   *
   * `shouldClaim` is asked once, before anything is written, whether this
   * redemption should spend a use. It exists so that a code pointing at a group
   * which can no longer be joined is still resolved — the caller needs the
   * address — without consuming the invite. An answer of `false` is not a
   * refusal: the group is reported as usual and nothing is recorded.
   *
   * It is deliberately a courtesy and not a control. The chain refuses the join
   * on its own, and this answer can be stale by one indexer run, so it may only
   * ever be used to decline to spend a use, never to grant a join.
   *
   * `expectedGroupContractId` is the group the caller believes the code admits
   * to — the one in the path of `POST /groups/:contractId/join`. When it does not
   * match the code's group the outcome is `not_found`, decided from the preview
   * read and re-checked under the lock, in both cases before a single row is
   * written. That ordering is the point: a client whose code and group came from
   * different places used to burn one of the invite's limited uses on a join that
