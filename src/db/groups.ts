/**
 * Read model over the indexer's chain-derived tables.
 *
 * WHAT THIS READS
 * `groups`, `group_members`, `contributions`, `payouts`, `protocol_fees` and
 * `decoded_events`, all created and written by `susu-indexer`. This service never
 * writes them: the indexer is the only writer, and the chain is the only
 * authority. Nothing here decides an amount, a recipient, or eligibility — it
 * reports what the contracts did.
 *
 * WHY RAW SQL
 * These tables are not declared in `src/db/schema.ts` (see that file for why), so
 * the queries name their columns explicitly. That is not only a consequence of
 * the ownership boundary but the point of it: every monetary column is selected
 * with `::text`, which is the cast the indexer's migration says a reader must
 * make. A query builder would infer the column type from a schema this service
 * does not own, and the inference is exactly the thing that silently changes when
 * a `numeric` crosses into JavaScript.
 *
 * Read-only by construction: there is no insert, update or delete in this file,
 * and `scripts/run-db-security-tests.sh` fails CI if a browser role can write to
 * these tables from the exposed schema.
