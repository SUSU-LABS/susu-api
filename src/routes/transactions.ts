/**
 * Transaction endpoints.

 *
 *   * `GET /transactions/:txHash` is public, like the group routes. Everything it
 *     returns is chain-derived and already visible to anyone reading the ledger,
 *     so there is nothing to authenticate.
 *   * `POST /transactions/prepare` is authenticated, because it spends this
 *     service's RPC quota on behalf of the caller and because an anonymous
 *     simulation endpoint is free compute for anyone who finds it.
 *
 * Neither of them signs, submits, or holds a key. Preparation fills in a footprint
 * and a fee; the wallet signs; the client submits.
