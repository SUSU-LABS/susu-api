/**
 * Invite endpoints: create a code, and join by redeeming one.
 *
 * NEITHER OF THESE GRANTS ACCESS
 * The contract decides who may join a group and enforces the member capacity.
 * Creating an invite is therefore not an authorization decision — there is
 * nothing to authorize, because an invite carries no authority. What the code
 * buys is discoverability: it lets someone who was told about a group find it
 * without knowing its contract address. That is why the code must be unguessable
 * and why the table it lives in is readable by no browser role at all.
 *
 * This also means the "may this user invite?" question has no useful answer here.
 * The natural rule — only members may invite — cannot be checked, because the API
 * does not know which wallet a user controls unless they have linked one, and the
 * chain decides membership by address. Refusing when we cannot check would break
 * inviting for the majority of users and protect nothing, since the group and its
 * contract address are already public.
 *
 * JOIN CLAIMS A USE, IT DOES NOT JOIN
 * The blockchain is the only thing that can add a member, so redemption cannot be
 * the join. What `POST /invites/redeem` does is validate the code, claim one of its
 * uses, and report which group the code admits to, so the client can send the
 * transaction that actually joins. A use is claimed before that transaction
 * succeeds, which is the conservative direction: a failed transaction wastes a use
 * rather than letting a limited code admit more members than it should.
 *
 * WHY REDEMPTION HAS TWO SHAPES
 * An invite link carries a code and nothing else — that is what makes it opaque.
 * The code is unique and its row names the group, so `POST /invites/redeem` needs
 * only the code, and reports the group so a client that arrived from a link can go
 * on to send the join transaction. Requiring the contract address there would mean
 * a link could never satisfy the request.
 *
 * `POST /groups/:contractId/join` is the same claim for a caller that already
 * knows the group, plus the assertion that the code belongs to it. The path's
 * group is not what identifies anything; it is a consistency check on the client,
 * for the case where the code and the group came from different places.
