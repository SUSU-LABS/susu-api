/**
 * The invite store against a real Postgres.
 *
 * The route tests inject a fake store, which cannot show whether a claim was
 * actually written - the thing this file exists to check. `uses` is a counter
 * with a ceiling, and the invariant that matters is not what the store returns
 * but what is left in the tables afterwards, so every assertion here reads the
 * rows back rather than trusting the return value.
 *
 * The specific case is a code that outlived its window: the group filled up and
 * started while the link was still circulating. Redeeming it used to spend a use
 * and only then let the client discover, from the chain, that joining was never
 * possible. The claim is now withheld, and "withheld" has to mean nothing was
 * written at all.
 *
 * The same rule covers a join that names the wrong group: the code resolves, but
 * the group in the path is not the group the code admits to, so there is no join
 * to spend a use on. That mismatch is decided before the write for the same
 * reason a withheld claim is.
